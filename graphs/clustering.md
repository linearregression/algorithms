##Clustering

###Goal

Given n points. Classify them into coherent groups (unsupervised labeling). Similarity measure for each pair - a distance function d(p,q) - symmetric. Same cluster = nearby.

Examples : Euclidean distance. Sequences - penalty for best alignment between two genome fragments. 

Objective function - k-means tbd.

###Max-Spacing k-clusterings

Seperated points - different clusterings. Min(p,q) of separated p,q.

Start with n points. Very much like Kruskal's.
