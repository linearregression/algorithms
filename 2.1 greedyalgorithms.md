##Greedy

Iteratively make myopic decisions.

Runtime is usually easy to compute.

Correctness is harder to prove. Three methods are :

"greedy stays ahead"

i) Induction

ii) Exchange argument

iii) Whatever works

##Cache Problem

###Problem Statement
small fast memory (L2 cache)
big slow memory (main memory)

process sequence of page requests
what to do on "fault" - cache miss. Which item to evict?

###Belady's Theorem
Belady - 1960s. Theorem : Natural greedy algorithm is best choice. "furthest in future" is best.

Not implementable, but LRU should do well. LRU is good if there is locality of reference - whatever was asked recently is more likely to be asked again.

Idealized benchmark for comparison.

Proof is by exchange argument. 

###Sketch of Proof
[See Carl Kingsford - Optimal Caching](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2009/cmsc451/lectures/Lec05b-optcache.pdf)

items n
cache C of size k
request order 1,5,8,9 ...
hit if item i is in C, miss otherwise
on miss, we swap out an item if cache is full
the replacements for a schedule.

Belady's Greedy Algorithm (Furthest-in-future):When d_i is requested but not in cache, evict from the cache the item furthest in future.

Let A be sequence of evictions for our greedy algorithm. Let OPT be an optimal algorithm. We show OPT and A will have same number of misses.

We contruct a series of sequences differing from OPT and closer to A, but with no change in misses.

Let S0 = OPT, statement is vacuously true (S0 and A agree for 0 steps)

Exchange Argument :

Let Sj agree with A for j steps. Now for j+1 step, there is a difference. A evicts e, Sj evicts f - suppose. We contruct Sj+1 which evicts e instead of f, and hence agrees with A for Sj+1 steps. We have to prove that #Sj+1 = #Sj.

After j+1 steps, Sj and Sj+1 differ in only one place. 
Sj   : .....e
Sj+1 : .....f

As long as e is not evicted by Sj, or f is not requested, there is no problem. Either of these two events has to happen before e is requested again, because e is furthest-in-future.

So, we choose Sj+1 as follows : If e is evicted by Sj first, Sj+1 will evict f in the same step - this will bring it back in sync with Sj. If, on the other hand, if f is requested first, Sj may evict some element h (since Sj has already evicted f). Now Sj+1 already has f, we we use the opportunity to evict h and bring in e, againt becoming same as Sj, with same no of misses.

Thus by induction, we see that no of misses in A = no of misses in OPT, for any given request order.


##Dijkstra's Greedy Algorithm for SSSP - Single Source Shortest Path

Input : Graph  G = (V,E), source vertex s, |E| >= 0

Output : L(v) for each v in V, where L(v) = length of shortest path from v to s

BFS works if |E| = 1. 

###Algorithm
X = {s}
A[s] = 0
B[s] = empty

while X <> V
    of all edges from X to V-X choose the one which minimizes A[v] + l(v,w) - call this edge (v*,w*)
    Add w* to X
    Set A[w*] = A[v*] + l(v*,w*)
    Set B[w*] = B[v*] U (v*,w*)

###Proof of correctness

This algorithm is greedy, because at each stage "greedy stays ahead", by induction.

Base case : X = {s}, A[s] = 0. Obviously greedy is best.

Assume greedy is ahead or equal for some X, with X <> V. Then let (v*,w*) be an edge s.t. A[v*] + l(v*,w*) is min of all edges from X to V-X. We prove that A[w*] = A[v*] + l(v*,w*) = L(w*) i.e. shortest path from s to v. This can be done by considering any other path from s to w - we can see that there must be an edge (y,z) in the path which crosses from X to V-X (it is possible for s = y, or z = w or both). By Dijkstra's algorithm A[y] + l(y,z) > A[v*] + l(v*,w*).

##Scheduling

###Problem

Shared resource
Many jobs, each with weight wj, with estimate length lj.

In which order should we sequence of jobs?

###Criterion - Completion Times
Cj - completion time of job j
Cj = sum of job times from 1 to j

###Objective Function
Many possible. 

Minimize Weighted Sum = min Sum wj*Cj

How to minimize over all possible n! sequences?

Special cases.
Same weight? shorter jobs first
Same length? larger weight first

Conflicting advice.

Score function : weight / length? weight - length? 

By ratio is best solution.

###Proof
A = greedy schedule
OPT = optimal schedule

Assume : 
    distinct wj / lj
    assume w1 = job with best ratio and so on.
    w1/l1 > w2 / l2 ..

    OPT : must have some consecutive jobs i, j where i > j. Let i, j denote the first such nos i.e. i has taken j's place.

Exchange Argument:

What happens if we exchange i and j? j takes less time, i takes more. No change to any other.

B = bi + bj = (C.wi + li.wi) + (C.wj + li.wj + lj.wj)

A = ai + aj = (C.wi + lj.wi + li.wi) + (C.wj + lj.wj)

B - A = li.wj - lj.wi

wi/li < wj/lj
lj.wi < li.wj
li.wj - lj.wi > 0
B - A > 0
B > A

Hence, completion time decreases => OPT is not opt. QED.

Exchange Argument - Handling ties:
    w1/l1 >= w2 / l2 ..
    We have to do repeated comparisons. For every inversion, we exchange. We are at least as good as OPT. Bubble sort in the algorithm.
